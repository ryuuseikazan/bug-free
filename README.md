# bug-free
Hi there !
I'm Eren.While i am testing this repository thing it would be a good idea to introduce myself.I am a college student and coding is in my interest list.I think even if i'll not gonna work in department like IT,software etc. i have to know coding.Cuz if i don't know the potential of something i work with, i can't do my job well.
Enough of this work etiquette, right? bye
